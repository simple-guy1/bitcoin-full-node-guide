# bitcoin-full-node
this repository serves me as guide for installing bitcoin full node on home Linux server<br>

I am writing this guide for myself in case I will need to go over Bitcoin full node (and related services) again in the future. 
I am not an expert in Bitcoin neither Linux, but I haven't found all-in-one guide covering path "from 0 to hero" anywhere on 
the internet, so I have decided to create one for myself. I would like to ask potential other readers (if any), open issue or 
even better open PR, in case you will find some mistake, I am in the end just a simple guy.

## setup
- old laptop Lenovo Thinkpad X240 with 8GB RAM and 1TB SSD (server)
- old Macboook Pro (client)

I want to use old Lenovo as a server hosting all Bitcoin related services and my Macbook Pro as client from which I will ssh 
into server and use other connected service through web browser.

## server OS 
**goal of this section:** to have clean installation of Linux distribution

I want some reliable Linux distribution so I did some quick research and came up with idea that Debian is the way. I found this 
[video](https://youtu.be/CJ41KZ0fBMc) where the guy explains installation fairly simply. After creating booting USB (16GB) with 
[balena etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) I installed:
- Debian bookworm with weekly updates
- GNOME windows environment

Luckily this Debian version doesn't require any additional tweaking and everything worked out of the box.<br>

To work more efficiently I use combination of zsh and starship installed according 
to this [tuotiral](https://harshithashok.com/tools/oh-my-zsh-with-starship/).

## server initial setup
**goal of this section:**  daily user has sudo permissions, laptop works with closed lid, client can ssh to server

During installation I created root user and my daily user, which I added to sudoers group following this 
[guide](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-user-to-sudoers-in-debian/).<br>

To disable sleep after closing laptop lid I update (uncomment and change) `HandleLidSwitch=ignore` in 
`/etc/systemd/logind.conf` file and privacy setup as:
![privacy setup after closed lid](./pics/screenshot-privacy-screen.png)
which ensures that after opening lid user password is required.<br>

To be able to connect from my client laptop to the linux server I had to setup `openssh-server` according to this 
[guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-enable-ssh-on-debian). For a firewall I didnt use ufw as I had some issues with it and open ports directly in **iptables**. First thing which I had to do is to enable SSH connection to the server. I followed this straightforward [tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/ssh-access-using-iptables). Once I enabled SSH I had to upload my client's SSH key to the server. I faced a small issue, because this wasn't my first server setup I had to reset server's fingerprint on my client with command `ssh-keygen -R <IP address of the server>`. To ssh into server without inserting user password run `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/<client-ssh-key>.pub <server-ip-address>`.

## Bitcoin Core on the server
**goal of this section:** Bitcoin Core (mainnet, testnet) runs as daemon and starts automatically after server restart

### Bitcoin Core initial setup
As I plan to potentially develop features in Bitcoin Core I want to have version built from github repository. For that I followed the notes for [unix build notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md) and specifically [ubuntu and debian](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md#ubuntu--debian) version.<br>

Once Bitcoin Core is setup I can run it as daemon with command `bitcoind -daemon` to start Bitcoin Core main chain. In be able to do [IBD](https://btcinformation.org/en/glossary/initial-block-download), I have to allow incoming connection on **Bitcoin port 8333** with `ufw allow 8333`<br>

To start Bitcoin Core testnet chain I have to run `bitcoind -testnet -daemon` and allow incoming connection on port *18333* with `ufw allow 18333`<br>

Next step is to config Bitcoin Core via [Jameson Lopp's Bitcoin Core Generator](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/). My current setup looks like this:
```
# Generated by https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/

# This config should be placed in following path:
# ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf

[main]
daemon=1
maxconnections=20
maxuploadtarget=250

[test]
daemon=1
maxconnections=20
maxuploadtarget=250
# Enable debug logging for all categories.
debug=1
# Log IP Addresses in debug output.
logips=1
```
As guide says this config has to be placed in `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`

### Bitcoin Core runs as service and automatically starts after server restart
For running Bitcoin Core as a service I followed this [guide](https://gist.github.com/jeffrade/0b730d226ff6f6b985f802d3c9191023) which was quite straightforward. I created second service to run Bitcoin Core on testnet as well. I found these two articles about multiple Bitcoin chains running on same servers. Maybe someone found them useful: [article 1](https://raphtyosaze.medium.com/how-to-run-multiple-bitcoin-blockchain-networks-on-the-same-computer-4efa031e7d26), [article 2](https://number1.co.za/running-a-mainnet-and-testnet-on-the-same-bitcoin-node/)

## recap what has been done so far
- set up old laptop as debian server
- connect other laptop to the server via ssh
- install Bitcoin Core from official github repository on the server
- set up Bitcoin Core daemons for main and test nets running as services

## install Electrum Server on the server
To be able to work with Bitcoin blockchain data I need indexed blockchain. For that purpose I chose [electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs).<br>

**goal of this section:** Electrum Server is isntalled and runs as service, which starts automatically after server is restarted<br>

Installation and initial setup was done following official [documentation](https://github.com/romanz/electrs/blob/master/doc/install.md) together with two parts videos on youtube: [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbG7hBMWQrs), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbOxgdHsyRI)<br>

My electrs config for mainnet looks like this:
```
network = "bitcoin"
daemon_dir= "$HOME/.bitcoin"
daemon_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:8332"
daemon_p2p_addr = "127.0.0.1:8333"

electrum_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:50001"
db_dir = "home/user/.electrs/db"
index_lookup_limit = 1000

log_filters = "INFO"
timestamp = true
```
electrs config for testnet:
```
network = "testnet"
daemon_dir= "/home/jirigrill/.bitcoin"
daemon_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:18332"
daemon_p2p_addr = "127.0.0.1:18333"

electrum_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:60001"
monitoring_addr = "127.0.0.1:4226"
db_dir = "/home/user/.electrs/testnet/db"
index_lookup_limit = 1000

log_filters = "DEBUG"
timestamp = true
```

Electrum Server requires RPC authentication setup in Bitcoin Core config, thus update to the **bitcoin.conf** is required. After the update following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0siLF9zmWo&t=304s) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hrnls92TxQ&t=1158s) video, the config file looks like this:
```
# Generated by https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/

# This config should be placed in following path:
# ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf

[main]
server=1
daemon=1
rpcauth=electrs:<hashed-password>


[test]
server=1
daemon=1
# Enable debug logging for all categories.
debug=1
# Log IP Addresses in debug output.
logips=1
rpcauth=electrs:<hashed-password>
```
Once Electrum Server is ready to be used I can create Electrum system service in a similar way as for Bitcoind. As template I use this [sample](https://github.com/romanz/electrs/blob/master/doc/config.md#sample-systemd-unit-file) where I have to only modify paths to directories and db.

systemd service definition:
```
[Unit]
Description=Electrs
After=bitcoind.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/github-repos/electrs
ExecStart=/home/user/github-repos/electrs/target/release/electrs --conf /home/user/.electrs/electrs.conf
User=user
Group=user
Type=simple
KillMode=process
TimeoutSec=60
Restart=always
RestartSec=60

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## install Electrum wallet on the server
To became self sorveign on Bitcoin network I have to start using wallet connected to my Electrum server. As first I will try the most straightforward solution - Electrum wallet. This wallet is possible to install multiple ways. I will try the simpliest one - install through GUI on the server. I can do it, because my server is laptop.

**goal of this section:** Install Electrum wallet on the server via GUI and connect it to my Elctrum server.

I download source code/Appimage and signatures from this [webpage](https://electrum.org/#download) and install it on the server.
